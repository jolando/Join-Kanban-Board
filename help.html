      <p>
        First of all this project has been created by the Developer Akademie
        students: Peter Rehmann, Sebastian Seitz and Adilet Sharshekeev

        <h2>Login</h2>
        <img class="help-img" src="img/login.png" />
        <p>
          If you haven't created an account yet, click the "Create Account"
          button in the top right corner. Alternatively, you can enter the site
          logging in.

        <h2>Board</h2>
        <img class="help-img" src="img/board.png" />
        <p>
          In the board section you can see the tasks which have been created.
          There are four columns which show you the status of each card. Every
          task starts off in the "to-do" column. After that, a task is in
          progress and later its functionality is being tested. Finally a task
          cards lands in the "done" column. Every card is draggable, so the
          members of the project can dynamically display their working process.
        </p>

      <div class="help-section">
        <h2>Backlog</h2>
        <img class="help-img" src="img/backlog.png" />
        <p>
          In the backlog section you can see an overview of all the created
          tasks. They will remain there even if they are already marked as
          "done" on the board. However, you can delete individual backlog cards
          if you wish to.

        <h2>AddTask</h2>
        <img class="help-img" src="img/addtask.png" />
        <p>
          In the Add Task section you can create a new task for your team. Find
          a title and a description for the task. You can also set the urgency
          and the category of the task. Additionally you must set a date at
          which the task is due. As a last step, add the user who is responsible
          for the task. Note that you cannot create a task until you have added
          a user.
